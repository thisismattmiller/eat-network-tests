    <h1>E.A.T. + LOD Network Visualization Tests</h1>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 4em;">Network visualization tests using the archival E.A.T. documents processed and stored in <a href="https://base.semlab.io/">Semantic Lab's Wikibase</a></p>

    <h2>Assoicated People 2D</h2>
    <div style="background: #d7d1c845; padding: 1em;">
      
      <a href="associated-people-2d/">View Network</a>
      <p>
This network links together E.A.T people who were mentioned together in the same document or context. Shows a “co-participation” network of possibly related individuals. Click on a person to view the document text that they were mentioned in.
      </p>

    </div>
    <h2>Assoicated People 3D</h2>
    <div style="background: #d7d1c845; padding: 1em;">
      
      <a href="associated-people-3d/">View Network</a>
      <p>
The same idea as the 2D version, but evaluating how useful it is to represent the network in three dimensions. No interaction, click nodes does nothing.

    <h2>Artworks 2D</h2>
    <div style="background: #d7d1c845; padding: 1em;">
      
      <a href="artworks-2d/">View Network</a>
      <p>
Shows all E.A.T. artworks currently in the Wikibase and the related individuals. The role of the person to the artwork is displayed, when you click on a node it opens the Wikibase page.
